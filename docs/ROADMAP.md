---

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Management Agent (Q2 2026)

**Problem**: Organizations lack good CMDB/asset management, making vulnerability remediation coordination difficult. Security teams struggle to get engineering teams to patch vulnerabilities.

**Solution**: AI agent that integrates with Wiz and SocketDev to enrich vulnerability findings, automate remediation via GitLab/GitHub, and provide actionable context in Jira tickets.

**Design Philosophy**: Complement existing tools (Wiz, SocketDev, GitLab, Jira), don't compete with them.

**Capabilities**:
- **Wiz Integration**:
  - Ingest vulnerability findings from Wiz
  - Ingest SBOM data (transitive dependencies)
  - Leverage Wiz's cloud asset inventory (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - Cross-reference Wiz findings with SocketDev

- **SocketDev Integration**:
  - Cross-validate dependency vulnerabilities
  - Supply chain risk analysis
  - Malicious package detection
  - Transitive dependency path tracing

- **SBOM Analysis**:
  - Analyze transitive dependencies (your-app → lib-a → lib-b → vulnerable-lib-c)
  - Trace vulnerability path through dependency tree
  - Recommend which direct dependency to update
  - Identify breaking changes in updates

- **Jira Ticket Enrichment** (Wiz creates ticket, AI enriches it):
  - Add business context (customer-facing? deployment frequency?)
  - Add GitLab/GitHub repository links
  - Add code ownership (CODEOWNERS, git history, PagerDuty)
  - Add remediation guidance (specific fix, estimated effort)
  - Attach GitLab MR/PR with automated fix
  - Add CI/CD test results

- **GitLab/GitHub Integration**:
  - Analyze repositories for vulnerable dependencies
  - Create merge requests with dependency updates
  - Trigger CI/CD pipelines for validation
  - Track MR/PR status and auto-close Jira when merged

  - **Container Images**: Update base images, rebuild, test (HIGHEST ROI)
  - **Dependencies**: Update package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod
  - **Dry-run mode**: Test fixes before applying
  - **Approval workflow**: Require human review before merge

- **Validation & Metrics**:
  - Re-scan with Wiz/SocketDev after fix deployed
  - Auto-close Jira ticket with evidence
  - Track MTTR by team
  - Identify bottlenecks in remediation process

**Integration Strategy**: Wiz → Jira → AI Agent → GitLab → CI/CD → Validation → Jira Closure

**Output**: Contextualized Jira tickets with automated fixes, reducing remediation time from weeks to hours

### Phase 3: Security Questionnaire Agent (Q2 2026)

**Problem**: Security teams spend dozens of hours per quarter filling out vendor security questionnaires (VSQs) with repetitive questions.

**Solution**: AI agent that ingests company security policies and automatically fills out security questionnaires.

**Decision**: Keep as part of Vaulytica (not separate product) because:
- Leverages existing RAG infrastructure (Document Intelligence Agent)
- Uses existing multi-LLM support (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
- Integrates with compliance frameworks already in Vaulytica
- Natural extension of Compliance Reporter Agent

**Capabilities**:
- **Policy Ingestion**:
  - Upload security policies (PDF, DOCX, Markdown)
  - Automatic parsing and indexing via RAG
  - Extract key security controls, procedures, certifications
  - Build searchable knowledge base

- **Questionnaire Processing**:
  - Support multiple formats (CSV, Excel, Google Forms, Word)
  - Parse questions and categorize by domain (access control, encryption, incident response, etc.)
  - Match questions to relevant policy sections via semantic search
  - Generate answers with source citations

- **Answer Generation**:
  - Multi-LLM support (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) for quality comparison
  - Confidence scoring for each answer
  - Flag questions requiring human review (low confidence, missing policy coverage)
  - Maintain consistent tone and terminology

- **Review Workflow**:
  - Export partially completed questionnaire for human review
  - Track which questions were auto-filled vs manually edited
  - Learn from human edits to improve future responses
  - Version control for policy updates

**Integration**: Standalone module within Vaulytica, uses existing RAG and LLM infrastructure

**Output**: 70-90% automated questionnaire completion, reducing hours to minutes

---

### Phase 4: Brand Protection Agent (Q3 2026)

**Problem**: Typosquatting domains enable phishing attacks against employees and customers. Manual detection and takedown is time-consuming.

**Solution**: Automated typosquatting detection, malicious intent validation, and cease & desist letter generation.

**Decision**: Keep as part of Vaulytica (not separate product) because:
- Natural extension of threat intelligence capabilities
- Integrates with existing URLScan.io and WHOIS capabilities
- Complements phishing detection workflows
- Relatively small scope (focused feature, not full product)

**Design Note**: No dnstwist integration needed - custom permutation generation is sufficient.

**Capabilities**:
- **Domain Permutation Generation**:
  - Character omission (gogle.com)
  - Character repetition (gooogle.com)
  - Character transposition (googel.com)
  - Homoglyphs (goog1e.com, gооgle.com with Cyrillic)
  - TLD variations (google.co, google.net)
  - Subdomain variations (login-google.com)

- **Domain Registration Monitoring**:
  - Daily checks for newly registered permutations
  - Certificate Transparency log monitoring
  - DNS resolution checks
  - WHOIS lookup for registration details

- **Malicious Intent Validation**:
  - URLScan.io screenshot capture
  - Content similarity analysis (compare to legitimate site)
  - Phishing indicator detection
  - Brand impersonation detection
  - SSL certificate analysis
  - Threat scoring (0-100)

- **Cease & Desist Generation**:
  - Generate legal-ready C&D letter with:
    - Domain details and evidence
    - Trademark information
    - Legal basis for takedown (ACPA, trademark infringement)
    - Registrar and hosting provider contact info
    - Evidence attachments (screenshots, WHOIS, DNS records)
  - Export to DOCX for legal team review
  - Optional: CLI download or web app download

- **Jira Integration**:
  - Create tickets for legal team follow-up
  - Attach all evidence (screenshots, WHOIS, C&D letter)
  - Track takedown status and response times

- **Takedown Tracking**:
  - Monitor domain status (still resolves? website accessible?)
  - Track time-to-takedown metrics
  - Update Jira ticket with progress

**Output**: Automated brand protection with legal-ready documentation, reducing manual effort from hours to minutes

## Additional "Boring but Critical" Use Cases

### 5. Onboarding/Offboarding Agent (Deprioritized)

**Problem**: Manual access provisioning/deprovisioning is slow and error-prone.

**Decision**: Deprioritized - Limited value if Okta Workflows already handles provisioning.

**Rationale**: If Okta Workflows automates provisioning/deprovisioning, there's limited room for AI to add value. Potential use cases (access review validation, anomaly detection, offboarding validation) are lower priority than other agents.

**Recommendation**: Revisit after core agents are mature, or if specific gaps in Okta automation are identified.

---

### 6. Detection Engineering Agent (Q4 2026)

**Problem**: Security teams receive thousands of alerts daily, most are false positives or low priority. Alert fatigue reduction IS detection engineering.

**Key Insight**: Rather than just suppressing alerts, improve the underlying detection logic to reduce false positives while maintaining true positive detection rates.

**Capabilities**:
- **Detection Analysis**: Analyze Datadog detection rules, raw logs, and alert outcomes
- **False Positive Reduction**: Identify FP patterns and recommend tuning (exclusions, threshold adjustments)
- **Automatic Test Detection Creation**: Generate TEST detections with proposed improvements
- **A/B Testing**: Run TEST detections in parallel with production for 7-14 days
- **Validation**: Compare TEST vs PROD (alert volume, TP rate, FP rate)
- **Detection Gap Analysis**: Identify incidents without detections, recommend new rules
- **Alert Outcome Tracking**: Learn from analyst decisions (TP/FP/Duplicate)
- **Automated Tuning**: Apply approved tuning to production detections

**Example Impact**: Detection with 96% FP rate → Tuned to 0% FP rate, 98% fewer alerts, 100% TPs preserved

**Integration**: Deep Datadog integration for detection rule management and alert analysis

---

### 7. Compliance Evidence Collection Agent (Q4 2026)

**Problem**: Audit preparation requires manually collecting evidence across dozens of systems.

**Capabilities**:
- Automated evidence collection for SOC2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS audits
- Screenshot/log collection with timestamps
- Automatic evidence mapping to control requirements
- Evidence repository with chain of custody
- Audit-ready evidence packages

**Integration**: Enhance existing Compliance Reporter Agent

---

### 8. Security Metrics & Reporting Agent (Q1 2027)
