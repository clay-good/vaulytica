| GuardDuty | ✅ PASSED | guardduty_ssh_bruteforce.json | Parses AWS GuardDuty findings |
| GCP SCC | ✅ PASSED | gcp_scc_privilege_escalation.json | Parses GCP Security Command Center |
| Snowflake | ✅ PASSED | snowflake_data_exfiltration.json | Parses Snowflake audit logs |

**Test Results:**
- All parsers successfully parse real test data
- Event normalization working correctly
- Asset and indicator extraction functional
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping operational

### 3. API Structure ✅

| Component | Status | Count | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Total Routes | ✅ PASSED | 102 | All endpoints registered |
| GET Endpoints | ✅ PASSED | ~60 | Read operations |
| POST Endpoints | ✅ PASSED | ~30 | Create operations |
| PUT Endpoints | ✅ PASSED | ~8 | Update operations |
| DELETE Endpoints | ✅ PASSED | ~4 | Delete operations |

**Key Endpoints Verified:**
- `/` - Root endpoint with API info
- `/health` - Health check with component status
- `/ready` - Kubernetes readiness probe
- `/live` - Kubernetes liveness probe
- `/metrics` - Prometheus metrics
- `/analyze` - Security event analysis
- `/incidents/*` - Incident management (15+ endpoints)
- `/forensics/*` - Forensics & investigation (15+ endpoints)
- `/streaming/*` - Streaming analytics (14+ endpoints)
- `/ai-soc/*` - AI SOC analytics (9+ endpoints)
- `/visualizations/*` - Interactive visualizations (6+ endpoints)

**Middleware Verified:**
- ✅ Rate limiting (100 req/60s per IP)
- ✅ CORS (configurable origins)
- ✅ GZip compression (min 1000 bytes)
- ✅ Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- ✅ Metrics collection

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### Bug #1: Missing Imports in api.py ❌ → ✅

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** API module failed to load

**Issue:**
```python
# Line 2800 in api.py
severity: Severity,  # NameError: name 'Severity' is not defined
```

**Root Cause:**
The `Severity` and `EventCategory` enums were used in function signatures but not imported from `vaulytica.models`.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Changed line 30 in api.py from:
from vaulytica.models import SecurityEvent, AnalysisResult

# To:
from vaulytica.models import SecurityEvent, AnalysisResult, Severity, EventCategory
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ API module now loads successfully
- ✅ All 102 routes registered
- ✅ No import errors

---

### Bug #2: EventType vs EventCategory Naming ❌ → ✅

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Backward compatibility issue

**Issue:**
The enum was renamed from `EventType` to `EventCategory` but some code/tests might still reference the old name.

**Root Cause:**
Inconsistent naming during refactoring.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Added to vaulytica/models.py after EventCategory definition:
# Alias for backward compatibility
EventType = EventCategory
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Both `EventType` and `EventCategory` work
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ No breaking changes for existing code

---
