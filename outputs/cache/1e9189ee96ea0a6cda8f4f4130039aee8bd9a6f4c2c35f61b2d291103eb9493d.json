      "who": "The key actors involved in this incident are:- Attacker: An unknown threat actor, potentially an external contractor or insider threat, who has compromised the account of a Snowflake user named CONTRACTOR_JSMITH.- Victim: The organization that owns the Snowflake 'CUSTOMER_DATA_PROD' database, which contains sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) data.- Affected User: CONTRACTOR_JSMITH, a Snowflake user with a 'DATA_ANALYST' role who has accessed and exfiltrated a large volume of sensitive customer data.",
      "what": "This is a case of data exfiltration, where a large volume of sensitive customer data has been extracted from a Snowflake production database by a compromised user account. The attacker executed a SQL query to retrieve 5 million customer records, including PII data such as names, email addresses, social security numbers, and credit card information, and then transferred approximately 14.65 GB of data out of the organization.",
      "when": "The security event was detected on 2024-01-21 at 15:30:45 UTC. The data exfiltration activity appears to have occurred during this time, with the attacker executing the SQL query and transferring the data out of the organization.",

      "why": "The attacker's motivation is likely financial gain, as the exfiltrated data includes sensitive PII that could be sold on the dark web or used for identity theft and fraud. The large volume of data stolen also suggests the attacker may have plans to leverage the information for further malicious activities.",
      "how": "The attacker gained access to the Snowflake user account 'CONTRACTOR_JSMITH', which had a 'DATA_ANALYST' role with access to the 'CUSTOMER_DATA_PROD' database and 'PII' schema. The attacker then executed a SQL query to retrieve a large volume of sensitive customer data, including PII, and transferred approximately 14.65 GB of data out of the organization.
