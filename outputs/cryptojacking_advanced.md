# Security Analysis Report

**Event ID:** d7e8f9g0h1i2j3k4l5m6n7o8p9q0r1s2  
**Analyzed:** 2025-10-12 18:59:46 UTC  
**Source:** AWS GuardDuty  
**Severity:** HIGH

## Executive Summary

An AWS EC2 instance has been identified as potentially compromised and being used for unauthorized cryptocurrency mining. The incident was detected by AWS GuardDuty, which observed the instance communicating with a known cryptocurrency mining pool using an encrypted channel. The instance shows signs of resource hijacking with elevated CPU usage and network traffic patterns consistent with mining operations. This appears to be a sophisticated cryptojacking attack using obfuscation techniques.

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk Score:** 8.0/10
- **Confidence:** 95%

## Attack Chain

1. Initial Access via Malware Infection
2. Persistence through Unauthorized Cryptocurrency Mining

## MITRE ATT&CK Techniques

| ID | Technique | Tactic | Confidence |
|----|-----------|--------|------------|
| T1496 | Resource Hijacking | Impact | 90% |

## Immediate Actions Required

1. Isolate the affected EC2 instance to prevent further spread of the malware
2. Collect forensic evidence from the instance, including memory dumps and network traffic captures
3. Notify the appropriate teams (security, operations, and application owners) to coordinate the incident response

## Short-Term Recommendations

1. Perform a thorough scan of the affected instance and the broader environment for indicators of compromise (IOCs)
2. Review and tighten security controls around EC2 instances, such as enforcing strong password policies, enabling multi-factor authentication, and implementing least-privilege access
3. Enhance monitoring and alerting for suspicious network activity, resource utilization, and cryptocurrency-related indicators

## Long-Term Recommendations

1. Implement a comprehensive cloud security strategy, including regular vulnerability assessments, security hardening, and continuous monitoring
2. Develop and test incident response and disaster recovery plans to ensure the organization is prepared to respond effectively to similar incidents in the future
3. Provide security awareness training to employees to help them identify and report suspicious activities, such as unauthorized cryptocurrency mining

## Investigation Queries

1. Identify all EC2 instances that have communicated with the IP address 185.220.101.45 on port 3333 within the last 30 days
2. Analyze the network traffic and resource utilization patterns of the affected EC2 instance to identify any other suspicious activities
3. Search for the presence of the 'XMRig' process or other known cryptocurrency mining tools on the affected instance and across the environment
